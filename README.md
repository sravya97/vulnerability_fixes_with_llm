# vulnerability_fixes_with_llm
## Overview

This repository contains research and experiments aimed at utilizing Large Language Models (LLMs) to automatically fix vulnerabilities in code. Explored various LLM types and training methodologies to enhance vulnerability mitigation techniques.

## Features

- Utilized multiple LLM models.
- Experimentation with training the models using datasets on BigML Server and TAMU HPRC Grace.
- Incorporation of the Juliet and AutoVAS datasets for training

# Usage

To replicate or extend our research, follow these steps:

1. Clone this repository to your local machine.
2. Explore the datasets in the `data/` directory and preprocess them as needed.
3. Train LLM models using the provided notebooks in the `notebooks/` directory.
4. Analyze model performance and experiment with different configurations.
